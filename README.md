# 🦅 RavenArc

**RavenArc** is a public DAO-powered initiative using decentralized tech to illuminate paths of safety, care, and visibility in a darkening world.

We are:
- 🛡 A blockchain-first rescue and dignity infrastructure
- 🕯 A mesh of Arc Lanterns (LightKeepers & allies)
- 🎨 Home of the RavenArc (Art & Rescue Coin) and RavenGift (The Raven Gift)

> Visibility is key to freedom. That’s why we build in the open.
